            Hola! Hello! My name is Alexis Quintu√±a. I'm a self-taught motivated
            developer with a hunger to learn and keep growing every day.
            Originality and simplicity is what I aim to create. Keeping the
            people engaged and inspired is my goal. Bringing your ideas to life
            is what I'm here to do.
            <br /> <br />
            I don't define myself for the work I've done because every day
            something new can be learned, but I will rather be defined by the
            work I want to do. I prefer to keep learning and challenging myself
            to do more.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm a fast learner, able to pick up new skills and easily adaptable to any given needs.
            On top of all of that I love working with others and get along with everyone and anyone.
            <br />
            <br />
